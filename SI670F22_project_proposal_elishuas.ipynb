    "The cost of prescription drugs are very expensive and costs continue to rise. The costs often hurt individuals who don't have insurance, and because they are so high these individuals cannot afford the medication they need to maintain their health. We would like to develop a model to forecast Medicare prescription drug costs so that consumers as end users are informed on future prices of various medications."

    "Given that we are predicting a real-valued target variable, we will use the mean squared error as our evaluation metric to assess the different learners. Along with experimenting with different classifiers, we plan on also experimenting with different subsets of features using variable selection algorithms and techniques as a part of tuning the model and doing an error analysis to see where the model is struggling in terms of performance. We can define success for the project as achieving a significant improvement in the mean squared error compared to the baseline and other models attempted."
